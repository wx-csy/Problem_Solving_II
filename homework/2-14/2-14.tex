  ``If'': we use mathematical induction to prove this. For base step, $a$ and $a$ are in the same set, and $a$ and $a$ are in the same connected component. For induction step, if $S$ is a set, then $S$ is either a set with only one element, or a set which is a union of two disjoint sets, say $S_1$ and $S_2$, connected by edge $(u, v)$ where $u \in S_1$ and $v \in S_2$. In the latter case, for every two elements $x$ and $y$ in $S$, if both $x$ and $y$ are in $S_1$ or $S_2$, then $x$ and $y$ are in the same connected component by induction hypothesis. Otherwise, assume $x \in S_1$, $y \in S_2$, then $x$ has a path to $u$, $v$ has a path to $v$, and there exists edge $(u, v)$, thus $x$ and $y$ are connected. Therefore, if two elements are in the same set, they are in the same connected component. \par
  ``Only if'': if $a$ and $b$ are in the same connected component, then there exists a path from $a$ to $b$. After the procedure executed, all edges in the path have been processed and all these vertices have been united, thus $a$ and $b$ are in the same set.

  There are $|E|$ edges, and for every edge, \proc{Find-Set} is called twice, thus \proc{Find-Set} is called $2|E|$ times in all. \par
  The edges, where \proc{Union} is performed, constitute the spanning trees of the connected components. For the $i$th connected component, assume there are $|V_i|$ vertices, then its spanning tree has $|V_i|-1$ edges. Therefore, there are $|V| - k$ edges in the spanning trees, so \proc{Union} is called $|V| - k$ times in all.
