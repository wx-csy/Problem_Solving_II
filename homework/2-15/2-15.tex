  \section{[CZ] Problem 1.14}
  Let $C$ denote a component of $G$. \par
  (1) $\rightarrow$ (2): Take any vertex $v_0$ in $C$. For any vertex $v_i$ which is connected to $v_0$, it must in $V(C)$, otherwise if we add $v_i$, along with the edges in the path from $v_0$ to $v_i$, to $C$, we get a proper connected supergraph of $C$, which leads to contradiction. Therefore, $V(C)$ is an equivalent class. Then we have to prove $C$ is the subgraph induced by $V(C)$. If not, let $C'$ be the subgraph induced by $V(C)$, and $E(C) \subset E(C')$, thus $C$ is a proper subgraph of $C'$, which leads to contradiction.  \par
  (2) $\rightarrow$ (1): Suppose, to the contrary that $C$ is a proper subgraph of a connected subgraph of $G$, denoted by $C'$. If $V(C) \subset V(C')$, there exists some vertex connected to $C$ but not in the equivalent class, which leads to contradiction. It is impossible that $V(C) = V(C')$, because the subgraph induced by $V(C)$ is the maximal subgraph whose vertex set is $V(C)$.

  \section{[CZ] Problem 1.16}
  For every $i$, we have a path from $u$ to $v_i$: $(u = v_0, v_1, \cdots, v_i)$, whose length is $i$. Thus $d(u, v_i) \leq i$. \par
  Suppose, to the contrary that $d(u, v_i) < i$, i.e. there exists path $(u_0 = v_0, u_1, \cdots, u_j = v_i)$, where $j < i$. Consider the walk $(u = u_0 = v_0, u_1, \cdots, u_j = v_i, v_{i+1}, \cdots, v_k = v)$, it's a $u-v$ walk shorter than the geodesic, which leads to contradiction. \par
  Therefore, $d(u, v_i) = i$ for each integer $i$ with $1 \leq i \leq k$.

  \section{[CZ] Problem 1.17}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Assume that $P$ is an $x - z$ path and $Q$ is a $u - w$ path, where $x \neq u, v$ and $y \neq u, v$, and they do not have common vertex. Let $y$ be a vertex in $P$ and $v$ be a vertex in $Q$, then there exists a $y-v$ path $(p_0 = y, p_1, p_2, \cdots, p_n = v)$. If there exists $p_i$ such that $p_i$ ($0 < i < n$) is in $P$ or $Q$, since $P \cap Q = \varnothing$, there exists a segment of the path, from any vertex in $P$ (let it be $y$), to any vertex in $Q$ (let it be $v$), such that the vertices in the segment are not in $P$ or $Q$, except the first and the last one. Assume $x - y$ is longer than $y - z$, and $u - v$ is longer than $v - w$, consider the path $x - y - v - u$, it is longer than the $x - z$ path and the $u - v$ path, which leads to contradiction.
    \item This is true. The geodesics are as well the longest paths in $G$, otherwise $\diam(G) > k$. Apply the conclusion we've proved in (1), we obtain that $P$ and $Q$ must have at least one common vertex.
  \end{enumerate}

  \section{[CZ] Problem 1.18}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item The minimum size of such a subgraph contains only the vertices and edges in a $u-v$ geodesic. Any connected subgraph containing $u$ and $v$ must have a $u-v$ path, which is at least as long as the geodesic. So a subgraph contains only the vertices and edges in a $u-v$ geodesic has less edges or vertices than other graphs.
    \item What is the maximum size of a connected subgraph of $G$ containing $u$ and $v$? It is $G$.
  \end{enumerate}

  \section{[CZ] Problem 1.22}
  If $u, v$ are in two different components of $G$, then $uv \in E(\overline{G})$, i.e. $d_{\overline{G}}(u, v) = 1$. \par
  If $u, v$ are in the same component of $G$, let $w$ be a vertex in another component $G$. We have $uw, wv \in E(\overline{G})$, i.e. $(u, w, v)$ is a path from $u$ to $v$, and thus $d_{\overline{G}}(u, v) \leq 2$. \par
  Therefore, $d_{\overline{G}}(u, v) = 1$ or $d_{\overline{G}}(u, v) = 2$.

      Now we are going to prove that it is impossible that $k \geq 4$. Suppose, there exists distinct $u, v, x, y$, such that $d_G(u, v) = d_{\overline{G}}(x,y) = k \geq 4$. Let $(u = w_0, w_1, \cdots, w_k = v)$ be a $u-v$ geodesic, $(x = z_0, z_1, \cdots, z_k = y)$ be an $x-y$ geodesic. We claim that there exists $i \in \set{0,k}$, such that $z_0 w_i$ is not an edge in $G$, otherwise, $(w_0, z_0, w_k)$ is a $u-v$ path shorter than the geodesic in $G$. Likewise there exists $j \in \set{0,k}$, such that $z_k w_j$ is not an edge in $G$. Hence, $z_0 w_i$ and $z_k w_j$ are edges in $\overline{G}$. If $i = j$, $(z_0, w_i, z_k)$ is shorter than $x-y$ geodesic, which is impossible. If $i \neq j$, $w_i w_j = w_0 w_k = u v$ is an edge in $\overline{G}$, otherwise $d_G(u, v) = 1$, contradicting the provided condition. Note that $(x = z_0, w_i, w_j, z_k = y)$ is an $x-y$ path shorter than the geodesic, which is impossible. \par
      Therefore, $k \leq 3$.

  \section{[CZ] Problem 1.25}
  Assume that $G$ is bipartite, with partite sets $U$ and $W$. Since $|V(G)| = |U| + |W| \geq 5$, at least one of $|U|$ and $|G|$ is greater than 2. Assume, without loss of generality, that $|U| \geq 3$. Let $u, v, w$ be three distinct vertices in $U$. They are mutually adjacent in $\overline{G}$, which forms an odd cycle. By Theorem 1.12, $\overline{G}$ is not bipartite. \par
  Therefore, if $|V(G)| \geq 5$, at most one of $G$ and $\overline{G}$ is bipartite.

  \section{[CZ] Problem 2.6}
  Consider the sum of the degrees over all vertices:
  $$\sum_{v \in V(G)} \deg v = n(n-1) + n^2 + n(n+1) = 3n^2$$
  By Theorem 2.1, $3n^2$ is even, thus $n$ is even.

  \section{[CZ] Problem 2.7}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item For every $v \in V(G)$, by the definition of bipartite graph, one of its incident vertices is in $U$, the other is in $W$. Therefore $m = \sum_{u \in U} \deg u = \sum_{w \in W} \deg w$.
    \item Let $x$ be the number of vertices of $G$ having degree 2. Then we have the following equation
    \begin{align*}
      \sum_{u \in U} \deg u &= \sum_{w \in W} \deg w \\
      3 \times |U| &= 2 \times n + 4 \times (|W| - n)
    \end{align*}
    After some algebra we get $n = 2$.
  \end{enumerate}

  \section{[CZ] Problem 2.9}
  Suppose that these odd vertices are not in the same component. Let $C$ be the component containing only one odd vertex. Component is an induced subgraph, so the degrees of its vertices do not change. The sum of the degrees over all vertices in $C$ is odd, which contradicts Theorem 2.1. \par

  \section{[CZ] Problem 2.10}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Let $K_a, K_b$ be two complete graph with degrees $a$ and $b$, where $a, b \geq 2$ and $a + b = n$. Let $u, v$ be any vertices in $K_a$ and $K_b$, respectively. Connect the two graphs by edge $uv$, we get a new connected graph $G$. For every nonadjacent vertices $x, y$, they are in two different complete graphs and $\set{x,y} \neq \set{u,v}$, otherwise they are adjacent. Assume that $x \in K_a$ and $y \in K_b$. If $x = u$ or $y = v$, $\deg x + \deg y = n-1$, otherwise $\deg x + \deg y = n-2$.
    \item If the graph has more than one components, remove any one of them. The remaining part of the graph has at most $n-1$ vertices, with $\deg u + \deg v \geq n - 2$ still holds. By Theorem 2.4, it is connected. Therefore, $G$ has at most two components.
    \item No. Instead of moving any component, we remove the one with greater order. The remaining part of the graph has at most $\lfloor n/2 \rfloor$ vertices. If $\deg u + \deg v \geq \lfloor n/2 \rfloor - 1$ for all nonadjacent $u, v$, the remaining part is connected. Thus $\lfloor n/2 \rfloor - 1$ is a shaper bound.
  \end{enumerate}

  \section{[CZ] Problem 2.13}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Suppose, to the contrary that $G$ contains more than two components. The component containing minimum number of vertices contains at most $\lfloor n/3 \rfloor$ vertices. The degree of every vertex in this component is at most $\lfloor n/3 \rfloor - 1$, less than $(n-2)/3$, which leads to contradiction.
    \item If $\deg v \geq (n-3)/3 = n/3 - 1$ for every vertex $v$ of $G$, $G$ might contain more than two components. For example, let $n$ be a multiple of 3, consider the graph $G = 3K_{n/3}$, for every $v \in V(G)$, $\deg v = n/3 - 1$, however, it contains three components.
  \end{enumerate}

  \section{[CZ] Problem 2.15}
  For every cycle in graph $G$, let $u, v$ be two distinct vertices in the cycle, and thus the cycle consists two $u-v$ path, whose lengths have the same parity. Therefore the cycle is an even cycle. By Theorem 1.12 $G$ is bipartite.

  \section{[CZ] Problem 2.20}
  Suppose, to the contrary that for every adjacent vertices $u$ and $v$, $\deg u = \deg v$. Since the graph is connected, for every distinct vertices $x$ and $y$, there exists an $x - y$ path. By transitivity of ``$=$'', we get $\deg x = \deg y$, i.e. $G$ is regular, which leads to contradiction.

  \section{[CZ] Problem 2.25}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item By Theorem 2.1, $\sum_{u \in V(G)} \deg u$ is even, thus $G-v$ has even order, therefore $G$ has odd order.
    \item Suppose, to the contrary, that there exists some component of odd order, denoted by $C$. Consider
    $$ \sum_{v \in V(C)} \deg v = r |V(C)|$$
    it is odd, which contradicts Theorem 2.1. Therefore, $G$ does not contain any component of odd order.
  \end{enumerate}

  \section{[CZ] Problem 2.27}
  For bipartite graph, we have $\sum_{u \in U} \deg u = \sum_{w \in W} \deg w$, so $r|U| = r|W|$. Eliminating $r$ yields $|U| = |W|$.

  \section{[CZ] Problem 2.28}
  Yes. When $G$ itself is an $r$-regular graph, the graph $H$ in Theorem 2.7 is equal to $G$, which of course has the smallest order.

  \section{[CZ] Problem 3.6}
  No. Consider the two graphs \par

  $G_1$ and $G_2$ have the same degree sequence. $G_1$ contains vertex $a$ of degree 2 that is adjacent to a vertex of 3 and a vertex of 4. $G_2$ contains vertex $b$ of degree 2 that is adjacent to two vertices of degree 3. However, $G_1 \cong G_2$.
  \section{[CZ] Problem 3.9}
  They are not isomorphic. Both $G_1$ and $G_2$ contain exactly two vertices of degree 2. In $G_1$, the two vertices of degree 2 (the leftmost one and the rightmost one) are adjacent to two vertices, however, in $G_2$, the two vertices of degree 2 (the top left one and the top right one) are adjacent to three vertices. Hence $G_1$ and $G_2$ are not isomorphic.

  \section{[CZ] Problem 3.11}
  Let $X = \set{v \in V(G): \deg_G v = n/2}$, $Y = \set{v \in V(G): \deg_G yv < n/2}$. We have
  $$ U = X \cup Y = X \cup \set{v \in V(G): \deg_G v < n/2} = X \cup \set{v \in V(\overline{G}): \deg_{\overline{G}} v \geq n/2} $$ \par
  Since $G$ is self-complementary, we have
  $$ |W| = |\set{v \in V(G): \deg_G v \geq n/2}| = |\set{v \in V(\overline{G}): \deg_{\overline{G}} v \geq n/2}| $$ \par
  $|U| = |W|$ implies $|X| = 0$, i.e. $G$ contains no vertex $v$ of degree $n/2$.

  \section{[CZ] Problem 3.13}
  This statement is true. Note that $d(i, j) = 1$ if and only if $i$ and $j$ are adjacent. Therefore, for every edge $uv \in E(G)$, $d_G(u, v) = 1$, thus $d_H(\phi(u),\phi(v)) = 1$, i.e $\phi(u)\phi(v)\in E(H)$. Likewise, if $\phi(u)\phi(v)\in E(H)$, then $uv \in E(G)$. By the definition of isomorphism, $H$ and $G$ are isomorphic.
